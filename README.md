# disk-lights
macOS app for showing disk activity in the menu bar.
Written in C (for IOKit integration) and Swift (for UI).

## background
I wanted an app that shows disk activity in a clean and configurable way, and that also supports removable USB disks and remembers.

The green symbolizes disk read access, and red means you are writing to disk. The bigger the blob is, the more you are reading or writing.

## status
Note that the app is still being developed as of September 2017 and I'll update this README once it can be tested.
