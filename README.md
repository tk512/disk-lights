# disk-lights
macOS app for showing disk activity in the menu bar.
Written in C (for IOKit integration) and Swift (for UI).

## background
I wanted an app that shows disk activity in a clean and configurable way, and that also supports removable USB disks and remembers.

## status
Note that the app is being developed as of April 2017 and I'll update this README once it can be tested.
